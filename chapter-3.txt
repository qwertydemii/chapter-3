        RESEARCH DESIGN
The researcher conducted a qualitative case study to study the influence of Bachelor of Science in Information Technology in fostering innovation among La Huerta National High School Grade 9 and 10 students. Our goal is to learn about students' opinions of Information Technology its role in society, and the skills required for success in this industry. We will use purposive sampling to conduct an online survey to collect qualitative data. The survey will ask students about their present use of technology, their impressions of information technology education at their school, career goals, coding experiences, barriers to using technology for learning, and their perspectives on upcoming technologies in education. We seek to convince students to take the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology course by using quantitative analysis to demonstrate the potential impact of information technology on future jobs and industry.

	METHOD OF RESEARCH
We are going to conduct a qualitative case study to study the role of a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology in fostering innovation among Grade 9 and 10 students at La Huerta National High School.

The study's participants will be chosen using purposive sampling. Students in grades 9 and 10 at La Huerta National High School will be asked to contribute.

An online survey will be prepared and shared to collect qualitative data.
